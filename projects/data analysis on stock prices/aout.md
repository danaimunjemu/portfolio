# About the Project: Stock Price Data Analysis

This project focuses on quantitative analysis of stock prices to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights. The goal is to build and enhance data-driven models that can assist in forecasting stock movements, assessing market risks, and optimizing trading strategies.

## Key Features

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

- Sourced historical stock price data from public APIs and financial databases.
- Cleaned and normalized datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- Visualized trends using moving averages, candlestick charts, and volatility plots.
- Analyzed key indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and momentum metrics.

**3. Model Development:**

- Implemented statistical models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH) and machine learning algorithms (e.g., LSTM, XGBoost) to forecast future stock prices.
- Backtested models using historical data to evaluate performance and refine parameters.

**4. Risk Assessment:**

- Applied Value at Risk (VaR) and Sharpe ratios for risk profiling.
- Incorporated portfolio optimization techniques using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).

## Tools and Technologies

- Languages: Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib), R
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Statsmodels
- Data Sources: Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance API
- Version Control: Git/GitHub

## Future Enhancements

- Integrating real-time data streams for live forecasting and trading.
- Automating model retraining using updated datasets.
- Developing a dashboard for interactive visualization of portfolio performance.

This project showcases my ability to bridge finance and data science, demonstrating practical skills in both quantitative research and software development. It also reflects my passion for financial markets, predictive modeling, and applying data-driven solutions to solve complex problems.
