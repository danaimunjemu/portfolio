# 01 Data Engineering Described

Data engineering involves:
- the develop, implement and maintain systems and processes that: (1) take raw data (2) produce high quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases

It is at the intersection of:
- security
- data management
- data ops
- data architecture
- orchestration
- software engineering

**From** `source system` **to** `serving for use cases`

## Lifecycle

1. Generation
2. Ingestion, Transformation, Serving & Storage
3. Analyst, ML, Reverse ETL

> Undercurrents
> Security, data amanagement, data ops, data architecture, orchestration, software Engineering
> These are the critical ideas across the entire lifecycle

Lifecycle - shifts the conversation from technology and towards the data itself.

> [!info]
> ETL - Extract, Transform, Load

Big data has to do with velocity, variety, and volume

**Upstream** - Data Engineering
**Downstream** Data Science and Analytics

### Data Science Hierarchy of Needs
1. Learn of optimise
2. Aggregate or label
3. Explore or transform
4. Move or store
5. Collect

80% of time is spent between 3, 4, and 5.

data from various sources -> data engineering -> data science and Analytics

Cost, agility, scalability, simplicity, reuse, and interoperability
Software engineering, networking, distributed computing, storage etc  -> *the balancing act of data engineering*

Data maturity affects dattttta engineering complexity - *the very data is leveraged as a competitive advantage*

>[!info]
Data maturity - progression towards higher data utilisation, capabilities and integration

Data maturity models:

Starting with data -> Scaling with data -> Leading with data

**Stage 1: Starting** - little to no goals    -> move fast, get traction and add value
**Stage 2: Scaling** - fornal data practices -> create scalable architectures, adopt best practices
**Stage 3: Leading** - organisation is data driven -> seamless intro of new data sources, automation

## Data Ops and Data architecture
Know how to:
1. Communicate with technical and non-technical team members
2. Scope and gather requirements
3. Agile, devops, data ops
4. Control costs
5. Kaizen

Always have the big picture
Production grade software engineering -> SQL, Python, JVM, bash
Deeply root yourself in fundamentals

Types of data engineer:
**Type A:** A = Abstraction (off the shelf)
**Type B:** B = Build (build data tools and systems)

Limit the infrastructure impact of a single user
